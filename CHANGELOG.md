## [1.0.0] - 2024-08-22

### Added
- **Core streaming security system** implementing buffer-and-veto approach
  - Real-time content filtering with configurable buffering (10-50 tokens)
  - Multi-layer security with regex patterns + LLM judge
  - Configurable risk thresholds and safe response templates
  
- **Comprehensive API endpoints**
  - `POST /chat/stream` - Main streaming chat with content filtering
  - `GET /chat/stream` - Legacy GET endpoint for backwards compatibility
  - `POST /assess-risk` - Risk assessment without streaming
  - `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
  - `GET /metrics` - System performance and safety metrics
  - `GET /config` - Current configuration settings
  - `GET /patterns` - Risk detection patterns and rules

- **Multi-pattern risk detection**
  - Email addresses (0.5 risk score)
  - Phone numbers (0.3 risk score)
  - SSN patterns (1.0 risk score, blocks by default)
  - Credit card patterns (1.0 risk score, blocks by default)
  - Secrets/credentials (0.8 risk score)
  - Harmful content (1.5 risk score, blocks by default)
  - Cumulative scoring for multiple patterns

- **LLM Judge integration**
  - Secondary AI-based content safety assessment
  - Conservative "when in doubt, block it" approach
  - Fail-safe design: errors default to blocking
  - Uses lightweight gpt-4o-mini for speed

- **Production-ready Docker deployment**
  - Multi-service Docker Compose setup
  - API container with FastAPI + streaming filtering
  - Nginx reverse proxy with security headers
  - Optional Redis for shared metrics
  - Optional monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana
  - Health checks and restart policies

- **Comprehensive configuration system**
  - Environment-based configuration with validation
  - Runtime parameter customization per request
  - Configurable delays, thresholds, and models
  - CORS configuration support

- **Real-time metrics and monitoring**
  - Request volume and block rate tracking
  - Performance timing and latency monitoring
  - Risk score distribution analysis
  - LLM judge usage statistics
  - Health monitoring with load balancer support

- **Interactive web interface**
  - Real-time testing with different risk scenarios
  - Parameter adjustment interface
  - System metrics dashboard
  - Built-in examples and test cases

- **Development and testing infrastructure**
  - Comprehensive test suite (200+ test cases)
  - Risk pattern validation tests
  - API endpoint functionality tests
  - Streaming with blocking scenario tests
  - Configuration validation tests
  - Error handling and edge case tests
  - Performance and metrics tests

- **Documentation and examples**
  - Complete README with Docker-first approach
  - Interactive example client with demos
  - API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
  - Development guide (CLAUDE.md)
  - Docker management scripts and Makefile

- **Security and safety features**
  - Context-aware safe response templates
  - Privacy protection with truncated logging
  - Fail-safe design defaulting to blocking
  - Audit logging for blocked content
  - Client disconnection handling
  - Rate limiting considerations

### Security
- **Defense in depth approach**
  - Fast regex filters for immediate pattern detection
  - LLM judge for nuanced content assessment
  - Configurable sensitivity thresholds
  - Safe template responses instead of errors
  - Comprehensive audit logging

- **Privacy protection measures**
  - Text snippets truncated to 100 characters in logs
  - Risk assessments don't store full content
  - Aggregated metrics without sensitive details
  - Proper client disconnection handling

### Performance
- **Optimized for low latency**
  - Fast regex patterns execute in microseconds
  - LLM judge only called for borderline cases (>0.8 threshold)
  - Configurable buffer sizes balance safety vs responsiveness
  - Time-based flushing prevents indefinite delays

- **Horizontal scaling support**
  - Stateless design supports multiple instances
  - Optional Redis for shared metrics across instances
  - Nginx load balancing configuration
  - Container orchestration ready

### Infrastructure
- **Docker-first deployment**
  - Optimized multi-stage Dockerfile
  - Complete docker-compose.yml with profiles
  - Production-ready nginx configuration
  - Health checks and monitoring
  - Volume management and persistence

- **Management tooling**
  - Convenience scripts (docker-run.sh)
  - Makefile for common operations
  - Automated testing and deployment
  - Environment configuration templates

## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Buffer-and-veto approach**: Chosen for balance between safety and responsiveness
- **Multi-layer filtering**: Combines fast pattern matching with AI-based assessment
- **Fail-safe design**: Defaults to blocking when uncertain or on errors
- **Docker-first**: Prioritizes containerized deployment for consistency and scalability

### Technical Implementation
- **FastAPI**: For high-performance async API with automatic documentation
- **LangChain**: For LLM integration and streaming capabilities
- **Pydantic**: For configuration validation and data models
- **Nginx**: For reverse proxy, load balancing, and security headers
- **Docker Compose**: For multi-service orchestration

### Performance Characteristics
- **Latency**: ~150-400ms additional delay for safety buffering
- **Throughput**: Handles concurrent requests with horizontal scaling
- **Memory**: Efficient token buffering with configurable limits
- **CPU**: Optimized regex patterns with minimal overhead

### Security Model
- **Risk Scoring**: Cumulative scoring system with configurable thresholds
- **Pattern Detection**: Comprehensive regex patterns for common PII/sensitive content
- **LLM Judge**: Secondary assessment for complex/nuanced cases
- **Safe Responses**: Context-aware template responses for blocked content
