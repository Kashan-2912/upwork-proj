COMPREHENSIVE ISSUE ANALYSIS & FIXES REPORT
==========================================

Based on the user's questions and testing, here are ALL the issues identified:

1. ✅ PATTERN SCORE ISSUE - FIXED! 
   - Was 404 error, now working correctly
   - SSN detection: Pattern Score 1.2 ✅
   - Email detection: Pattern Score 0.4 ✅  
   - Credit card: Pattern Score 0.5 ✅
   - Phone: Pattern Score 0.5 ✅

2. 🚨 TOKEN FLOW ISSUE - MAJOR PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
   - User asked: "what is the token flow is it considered to show ai output tokens or person input tokens"
   - ISSUE: Window analysis shows USER INPUT correctly (✅) BUT...
   - ISSUE: Individual token stream shows NO TOKENS AT ALL (❌)
   - Analysis shows 0 AI tokens generated when there should be many
   - Window analysis works but token-by-token flow is broken

3. 🚨 REAL-TIME RISK SCORING ISSUE - CRITICAL BUG  
   - User said: "why the real time risk scoring dont work as expected"
   - ISSUE: All token risk scores are None instead of actual values
   - Window analysis shows correct scores (0.765) but individual tokens show None
   - Frontend cannot display risk scoring because data is None

4. ✅ TOKEN COUNTING - WORKING CORRECTLY
   - User said: "i didnt understand how it counts tokens sometimes i feel that they are wrong"
   - ANALYSIS: Token counting is actually CORRECT
   - Local tiktoken: 8 tokens matches API: 8 tokens ✅
   - Window positions match expected values ✅

5. ❌ PATTERN SCORE IN FRONTEND - WAS ALWAYS 0 ISSUE
   - User said: "why the pattern score always 0"
   - ROOT CAUSE: Frontend was likely getting data before our fixes
   - Now backend correctly returns pattern scores (1.2, 0.4, 0.5, etc.)
   - Frontend needs to refresh to see correct values

CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:
=====================

FIX #1: Token Flow - No tokens being generated/streamed
FIX #2: Risk Scoring - All token risk scores are None  
FIX #3: Frontend refresh to show correct pattern scores

The sliding window analysis works perfectly but the token-by-token 
streaming is completely broken - no tokens flow at all!
