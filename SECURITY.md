# Security Policy

## Overview

The Blocking Responses API is designed as a defensive security tool to prevent potentially harmful content from being streamed to users. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Features

### Content Filtering

- **Multi-layer detection**: Regex patterns + LLM-based assessment
- **Real-time blocking**: Prevents sensitive content from reaching users
- **Configurable thresholds**: Adjustable sensitivity for different use cases
- **Fail-safe design**: Defaults to blocking when uncertain

### Data Protection

- **No persistent storage**: Content is not stored permanently
- **Truncated logging**: Log entries are limited to 100 characters
- **Anonymized metrics**: Aggregated statistics without sensitive details
- **Memory safety**: Buffers are cleared after processing

### Infrastructure Security

- **Non-root containers**: Docker containers run as non-privileged user
- **Security headers**: HTTP security headers enabled via Nginx
- **Input validation**: All API inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate limiting ready**: Infrastructure supports rate limiting implementation

## Threat Model

### Assets Protected

1. **User privacy**: PII and sensitive information in LLM responses
2. **System integrity**: API functionality and configuration
3. **Service availability**: Continuous operation of filtering services

### Threats Addressed

1. **Information disclosure**: Accidental sharing of sensitive data
2. **Prompt injection**: Attempts to bypass safety filters
3. **Resource exhaustion**: DoS through resource consumption
4. **Configuration tampering**: Unauthorized changes to security settings

### Security Boundaries

- **Input sanitization**: All user inputs are validated
- **Output filtering**: All LLM outputs are screened before delivery
- **Process isolation**: Components run in isolated containers
- **Network segmentation**: Services communicate over defined interfaces

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue:

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### Reporting Process

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourdomain.com] (update with actual email)
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)
3. **Encrypt**: Use PGP encryption if possible (key available on request)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 5 business days
- **Status updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is released (coordinated disclosure)

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security:
- Public acknowledgment (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- Hall of fame listing for significant discoveries
- Swag and recognition for valuable contributions

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Configuration
- **Use strong API keys** and rotate them regularly
- **Set appropriate thresholds** based on your security requirements
- **Enable logging** for security monitoring
- **Regular updates** to the latest version

#### Deployment
- **Use HTTPS** in production environments
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Monitor metrics** for unusual patterns
- **Regular security assessments** of your deployment

#### Environment
- **Secure environment variables** (use secrets management)
- **Network isolation** (firewall rules, VPC/network policies)
- **Access control** (limit who can modify configuration)
- **Regular backups** of configuration and logs

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input validation**: Validate all inputs at API boundaries
- **Output sanitization**: Ensure outputs don't contain sensitive data
- **Error handling**: Don't expose internal details in error messages
- **Dependency management**: Keep dependencies updated

#### Development Practices
- **Security reviews**: All changes undergo security review
- **Automated scanning**: CI/CD pipeline includes security scans
- **Secret management**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Principle of least privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

1. **Input Layer**: Request validation and rate limiting
2. **Processing Layer**: Content analysis and risk assessment
3. **Output Layer**: Response filtering and safe templates
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Container isolation and network security
5. **Monitoring Layer**: Logging and alerting for security events

### Security Controls

#### Preventive Controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Content filtering and blocking
- Access controls and authentication
- Network segmentation

#### Detective Controls
- Comprehensive logging
- Metrics monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Security event alerting

#### Corrective Controls
- Automatic safe responses
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Graceful degradation
- Incident response procedures

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards
- **OWASP Top 10**: Mitigations implemented for web application risks
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Aligned with identify, protect, detect, respond, recover
- **ISO 27001 principles**: Information security management best practices

### Privacy Regulations
- **GDPR compliance**: Privacy by design, data minimization
- **CCPA compliance**: Consumer privacy rights respected
- **HIPAA considerations**: Healthcare data protection principles

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

1. **Critical**: Active exploitation, data breach, service compromise
2. **High**: Vulnerability with high impact, potential for exploitation
3. **Medium**: Security weakness with moderate impact
4. **Low**: Minor security improvement opportunity

### Response Procedures

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Analysis**: Impact assessment and root cause analysis
3. **Containment**: Immediate actions to limit impact
4. **Eradication**: Remove vulnerabilities and malicious content
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations safely
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

## Security Updates

### Update Policy
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Patched within 24-48 hours
- **High severity issues**: Patched within 7 days
- **Medium/Low issues**: Included in next regular release
- **Zero-day exploits**: Emergency response procedures activated
